Function:

I put the weight function with a high influence factor with weight 0.4 as sum_duration and 
If the dog is Golden Retriever, it should have a high user satisfication.

They are the assumption I made in my function. 
So the model performance should be similar to the input function weight to prove the model efficacy.
